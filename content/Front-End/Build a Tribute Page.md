This project is from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tribute-page).

## Prerequisite

* HTML5
* CSS
* Optional 
	* Responsive Design with Bootstrap
	* jQuery, JavaScript

You do not need to understand all knowledge of HTML5 and CSS. [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map) offers a tutorial that is sufficient to complete the project.

## Requirement

**Objective**: Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) app that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/).

**Rule**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

* [ ] I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
* [ ] I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

Optional:

* [ ] I upload the website to GitHub.
* [ ] I give the website a subdomain of my personal domain. 

Remember to ask questions in [Discord](https://discord.gg/yRWHfg) if you get stuck.
