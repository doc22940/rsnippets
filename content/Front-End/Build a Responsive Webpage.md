This is an Anonymous project.

## Prerequisite

* HTML5
* CSS
* Optional
	* Bootstrap

## Requirement

**Objective**: Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) webpage that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/kingsfull123/pen/zwrOZr](https://codepen.io/kingsfull123/pen/zwrOZr).

**Rule**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

* [ ] I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
* [ ] I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
* [ ] I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
* [ ] I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

Optional:

* [ ] Upload the website to GitHub.
* [ ] Give the website a subdomain of my personal domain.

**Note**: CodePen.io overrides the `Window.open()` function, so if you want to open windows using jQuery, you will need to target invisible anchor elements like this one: `<a target='_blank'>`.
