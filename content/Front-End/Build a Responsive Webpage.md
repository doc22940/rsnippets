This is an Anonymous project.

## Prerequisite

* HTML5
* CSS
* Optional
	* Bootstrap

## Requirement

**Objective**: Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) webpage that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/kingsfull123/pen/zwrOZr](https://codepen.io/kingsfull123/pen/zwrOZr).

**Rule**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

* [ ] The webpage automatically realigns whenever the browser size is changed.
* [ ] The grids allign properly when display size is changed.
* [ ] The images are flexible.

**Note**: CodePen.io overrides the `Window.open()` function, so if you want to open windows using jQuery, you will need to target invisible anchor elements like this one: `<a target='_blank'>`.
