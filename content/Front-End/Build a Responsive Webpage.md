This project is contributed by [Mudigonda Sai Kaushik](https://github.com/IceDune).

## Prerequisite

* HTML5
* CSS
* Optional
	* Bootstrap

## Requirement

**Objective**: Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) landing page that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/kingsfull123/pen/zwrOZr](https://codepen.io/kingsfull123/pen/zwrOZr).

Here are some ideas you can consider.
 
* a physical product (e.g., books, cell phones)
* a website (e.g., FaceBook)
* a python library (e.g., NumPy)
* a JavaScript framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Vue)
* a npm package (e.g., ulp-markdown)
* an organization (e.g., Women Who Code)
* a programming lanugage (e.g., JavaScript)
* a location (e.g., U.S.)


**Rule**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

* [ ] The webpage automatically realigns whenever the browser size is changed.
* [ ] The grids align properly when the display size is changed.
* [ ] The images are flexible.

Optional:

* [ ] I upload the website to GitHub.
* [ ] I give the website a subdomain of my personal domain. 
* [ ] I polished my portfolio page from  "[Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage](/front-end/build-a-responsive-webpage/)" project to be responsive.

**Note**: CodePen.io overrides the `Window.open()` function, so if you want to open windows using jQuery, you will need to target invisible anchor elements like this one: `<a target='_blank'>`.
