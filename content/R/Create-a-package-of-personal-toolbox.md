## Prerequisite

* Read a short tutorial of building R packages, such as [this one](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/).

It is not necessary to finish reading the Hadley Wickham's whole book, [R package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/), before you start the project.

## Requirement


**Objective**: Build an R package containing your frequently used R code. 

Here is an [example from Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/xfun). 

**Rule**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself first.

Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

* [ ] I can use functions in the package after installing it.
* [ ] The functions in the package work as I expected.

Optional:

* [ ] I upload the package to GitHub.
* [ ] I create a GitHub README.md to instruct people how to install my R package from GitHub.
* [ ] I write instructions on how to use my package on README.md or a post on the personal blog or a website dedicated to the package.

Remember to ask questions in [Discord](https://discord.gg/yRWHfg) if you get stuck.

## Advanced

* [ ] After reading each chapter of the book [R package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/), I revisit my package and polish it.
