## Prerequisite

* `gulp.task`

You do not need to understand all knowledge of Gulp. 

## Requirement

**Objective**: Build a webpage automatically synced to GitHub repo's README.md. 

Here is an [example](http://mustwatch.yingjiehu.com/) and [its README.md](https://github.com/huyingjie/must-watch-must-watch). 

**Rule**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

* [ ] I can edit README.md in the GitHub repository so that the website will generate content automatically from README.md

Optional:

* [ ] I give the website a subdomain of my personal domain. 
* [ ] A third party service will deploy and update the website whenever I change README.md.

Remember to ask questions in [Discord](https://discord.gg/yRWHfg) if you get stuck.
